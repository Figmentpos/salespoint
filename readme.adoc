## Documentation

The reference documentation is written in Asciidoc and built using Asciidoctor. The main documentation source file is located in `src/main/asciidoc`.

To build the reference documentation simply run `mvn generate-resources` on the command line. This generates the following HTML files:

* the Salespoint reference in `target/generated-docs/salespoint-reference.html`.

<server>
    <id>salespoint</id>
    <username>…</username>
    <password>…</password>
